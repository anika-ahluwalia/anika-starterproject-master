My version of dash starts by bringing you to a blank canvas.
One can add nodes to this canvas by clicking the buttons on the side
of the canvas to add different kinds of nodes. When that a button
to add a node is clicked (if the canvas is in freeform), a node
will appear at a random location on the screen. Many nodes can be 
added at a time. When the triangle in the bottom right corner of 
a node is clicked and dragged, the node will resize. When the red 
X button at the top of a node is clicked, that node is removed from 
the canvas. If you click the duplicate button on a node, it will 
duplicate it behind it. 
The user can also switch between different collection views (freeform,
grid, and stack view). In freeform view, all the nodes are in random
location and can be moved around. In grid view, the nodes are organized 
in a grid and will be added in the grid but can not be moved around. 
In stack view, the nodes are organized in stacks of each node type and
they can not be moved around. When the user switches between collection
views, the nodes' positions are changed.
The user can also zoom in and out in a collection (the biggest canvas 
or the collections) by pressing the zoom in and zoom out buttons.
The user can also create collection nodes and can do anything in the
collection nodes that they could do in the original freeform canvas (make
new nodes, zoom in and out, change the collection view, and link nodes
together).
The user can link nodes together by clicking the "Add Link" button on the
both the nodes that the user would like to link together. Then a link will
appear behind the nodes. When the user clicks on the link, it will 
move the screen to center the node that the click was further from.
